ECMAScript Assignment- 1 March 2019


What is the difference between null and undefined ?
-Undefined means a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value. 
               eg. var fruits; //undefined     
               //this is undefined because a value has not been assigned to the variable called fruits.
 

-Null indicates the absence of value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.
               eg. var fruits = null;  
                   typeof fruits // 'object'
                      //the variable fruits has no value.
Therefore the difference between the two is that undefined is a type itself while null is the object.
